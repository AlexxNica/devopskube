To use this in \nRedmine\n, we do use a forked and adopted version of the \nOpenId Connect Plugin\n (Note the two Pull-Requests to the original version of the plugin).\n\n\nSome configuration changes in the Keycloak System are needed to make this work, these changes are documented in here. Furthermore some hints for the settings of the Redmine OpenId Connect Plugin are shown.  \n\n\nKeycloak Settings\n\n\nAll Settings done in the Keycloak Server are described in this section.\n\n\nKeycloak Client\n\n\nThe Keycloak client needs to get configured in the following way. The Client needs to have a unique name (in this case 'redmine') and the 'Access Type' needs to get defined as 'confidential'. Please note especially the 'Valid Redirect URIs', which needs to get set to the URL of the Redmine System (http://loccalhost:3000 in the screenshot).\n\n\n\n\nKeycloak Credentials\n\n\nBecause we have set the 'Access Type' to 'confidential' we do get offered the Credentials Tab. On this tab, we get a secret, which needs to get put into the corresponding Setting of the Redmine OpenId Connect plugin. This secret allows to initiate a secure connection between the Keycloak System and your client application (Redmine in this case).\n\n\n\n\nKeycloak Roles\n\n\nThe Redmine OpenId Connect plugin provides configuration options to be able to recognize a user as an admin, by using a specific Role and or just a normal User (by using another role and/or by providing no role in the configuration). To be able to use these possibilities, those roles ('User' and 'Admin') need to get configured in the Keycloak Client and later need to get assigned to the concrete user.\n\n\n\n\nKeycloak Mappers\n\n\nIn order to provide some necessary user information to the Redmine System, the standard Keycloak Mappers have to be adopted and a new Mapper has to get created.\n\n\n\n\nThe 'username' Mapper is usually mapped to the 'preferred_username' Token Claim Name. This needs to get adopted to 'user_name' in order that the Redmine OpenId Connect Plugin can use this information.\n\n\n\n\nFurthermore the Role Mapper has to get created. This mapper (with the name 'mapper_of') has to be set to be of the Type 'User Client Role', and will contain the Client Role, the user is a member of.   \n\n\n\n\nKeycloak Scope\n\n\nIt is necessary to assign the wanted Client Roles to the Scope of the Client. This has to be done on the Scope-Tab. Both above created Roles ('User' and 'Admin') have to get assigned to the Scope.\n\n\n\n\nRedmine OpenId Connect Settings\n\n\nThe Settings done in the OpenId Connect Plugin Settings page are described in here.\n\n\nThe most relevant settings are the 'Client ID', the 'OpenID Connect server url' and the 'Client Secret'.\n\n\nThe 'Client ID' is the name of the client in your Keycloak System (redmine in our case). By Specification, this should be a URI, but a plain name is working as well, and seems to be easier IMHO.\n\n\nThe 'OpenID Connect server url' has to be set to the Keycloak Server with the path /auth/realms/\n. This is where you can access the dynamic Configuration Settings of Keycloak (https://KEYCLOAK_SERVER/auth/realms/\n). Obviously the KEYCLOAK_SERVER has to be exchanged with the name of the Server, where your Keycloak system is running, and the REALMNAME has to be replaced with the Keycloak Realm, your client is associated to.\n\n\nThe 'Client Secret' is the secret found in the Keycloak Credentials page (see above), and should be copied from there.\n\n\n\n\nHints\n\n\nIn our forked version of the \nRedmine OpenId Connect Plugin\n we added a setting, to be able to avoid the Validation of SSL Certificates ('Disable Ssl Validation'). This should just be used on Development Systems and not on Production Environments, therefore usage of this setting is on your own risk.\n\n\nTo be still able to login into Redmine during the testing and configuration phase (eg. your Keycloak is not working correctly or your settings in Redmine are not correct already), you can use the login URL with the parameter 'loccal_login', which allows you to login using the Redmine login form (eg. http://localhost:3000/login?local_login=true).\n\n\nVia the Keycloak Url https://KEYCLOAK_SERVER/auth/realms/\n/.well-known/openid-configuration you can retrieve all endpoints available on the Keycloak server.",

Furthermore the configuration for these components is provided and documented. All necessary steps to setup a single node cluster (based on \nCoreOS\n) will be documented as well.\n\n\nFurthermore provide tools/documentation on how to generate the charts and offer a download-area for those.\n\n\nThis will be a pre-liminary version to provide all the components and steps to build up the future \"development\" environment.\n\n\nVersion 0.2\n\n\nAdd additional components for eg. SSO and other things, which can be useful in an SDLC Stack:\n\n\n\n\nKeycloak\n - SSO Solution\n\n\nELK\n - Log Stack\n\n\n\n\nVersion 0.3\n\n\nAdditional functionality to be able to create projects via a single REST-API call. This is the first version with some unique functionality. The REST-API should include a web-based client as well as a Command-line client.\n\n\nVersion 0.4\n\n\nAdd additional components to the Stack to provide a fully featured SDLC Stack. These components could be:\n\n\n\n\nGerrit\n - Web based code Review\n\n\nRocket.chat\n - A chat application\n\n\nGitBucket\n - An open source Github clone (replace Gogs?)\n\n\n\n\nVersion 0.5\n\n\nMake all of the components (if upstream allows) HA-able. Furthermore integrate those as much as possible.\n\n\nVersion 0.6\n\n\nBe self-hosted. We should eat our own dog-food, therefor we should host this project on our own Kubernetes Cluster. We do look for a in-expensive Hosting solution here. Do you like to offer your Hosts?",
